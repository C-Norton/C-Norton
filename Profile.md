Hi, My name is Channing Norton; though you may see older references to me and my work by the name Channing Helmling-Cornell, or variations thereof, as not all services liked how long my old last name was, or the hyphen.

This GitHub serves as my portfolio as a software developer. It was last updated on 2021/21/06

I pride myself on being a technology generalist that can learn how to produce quality of work in a variety of areas quickly, with a solid base of fundamental skills.

This document will outline the projects I have done, the technologies I have worked with, what I'm looking to learn, and what I'm working on right now. Not all of my repositories are public, and not all the code I've produced is mine to share or showcase. Furthermore, smaller projects like one off scripts may not ever get entered into version control, though anything spanning more than a day or two's work for me does end up here now that github finally has private repos for free.

I've broken these technologies up by category. Programming languages at the top, IT platforms and skills at the bottom

### Skill levels
Exposed - Exposed skills are those that I have toyed with briefly, or worked with tangentally on a project. I would not be confident in immediately producing work relying on those skills, but would have a head start on learning them quickly by virtue of the familiarity gained. This is equivalent of 1 to 5 hours of working with the technology
